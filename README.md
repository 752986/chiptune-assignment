# Chiptune assignment

![The digital samples that make up a sound file](./images/sine_samples.png)

This is an assignment about sound waves that I made for classmates in my programming class.

Look at [assignment.md](./assignment.md) for the assignment description. If you're done and you want to see my solutions, take a look at the `main` branch **(do not do that if you aren't done yet)**.
